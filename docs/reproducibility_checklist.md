- [x] `results/raw_seed_metrics.csv`
- [x] `results/ablation_metrics.csv`
- [x] `results/stress_sweep.csv`
- [x] `results/negative_cases.csv`

- [x] `results/stress_sweep_raw.csv`
- [x] `paper/main.tex`
- [x] Canonical PDF: `C:/Users/wangz/Downloads/85.pdf`

## What Does Not Reproduce
- [ ] Real robot results.
- [ ] High-fidelity benchmark runs.
- [ ] Trained human-correction boundary-model checkpoints from real robot traces.
- [ ] External active-learning, preference-learning, residual-correction, and human-in-the-loop baselines.

This is reproducible as a local negative evidence audit, not as an ICLR-main robotics system paper.
